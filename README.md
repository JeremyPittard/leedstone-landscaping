# LeedStone Landscapes - New Website (Under Cultivation)

This README.md provides information about the project structure and commands for the LeedStone Landscapes website, which is currently under development.

## Project Overview

LeedStone Landscapes is building a new website using Astro and Tailwind CSS to better serve our customers in Perth, Western Australia. This temporary landing page is a placeholder while the full site is under development.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ # Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro # Base layout for your pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro # The main landing page
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.mjs # Tailwind CSS configuration file
â””â”€â”€ package.json       # Lists project dependencies and scripts
